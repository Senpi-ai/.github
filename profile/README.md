Senpi is open, modular, and infinitely extendable. An autonomous onchainGPT that informs, remembers, learns, trades, mints.

It is powered by the **Senpi Eliza Skills Framework**, a powerful open-source multi-agent framework, based on the [Eliza Framework](https://eliza.how/), that enables developers to build custom Skills and expand the capabilities of the Senpi AI Agent.

To dive deeper into the Senpi Eliza Skills Framework, check out our official üìñ [developer documentation](https://developer.senpi.ai).
